### Day 0: Hello, World!
###### Objective:
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank.
###### Task:
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

### Day 1: Data Types
###### Objective:
Today, we're discussing data types.
###### Task:
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
	a. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
	b. Print the sum of s plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
	c. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
